## Features

### Items List
From the main menu, you can access a menu that allows you to toggle which items must be collected.

### In-Game Tracker
In a run, you can see a board containing every item to collect. The board will automatically update itself when a new item is collected and will let you know of your progress. You can scroll through the pages with `Page Up` and `Page Down` or hide the board with `P` (all keybinds are changeable).

### Save File Safe
This mod doesn't affect the save file in any way. You can use this mod with an old save file and it will track correctly.

### Modding Safe
This mod can handle any modded item created using `LethalLib`. There might be some items that are unobtainable, but still will be registered.

## Known Issues

### Different Timings
This mod uses a vanilla method to detect when items are brought or taken. This can lead to a small delay between the clients to detect that an item was modified.

### Loot Spoilers
Since `RuntimeIcons` generates the icons when an item spawns and this mod can use these icons, it is easy to see which items were spawned from the board. It is advised to play at least a game with the mod, then do real runs.
